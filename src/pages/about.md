# Introduction

Hello there. You can call me **Haikal**. I'm a technology enthusiast hailed from **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**. I've dabbled in various aspects of Information Technology especially in the following:

- `Software and Hardware troubleshooting`
- `Network and Infrastructure`
- `System Administration`
- `Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science`
- `Blue/Red Team Cybersecurity`

I created this blog as digital method to document my life, seeing as how little presence I have in social media.

My bachelor is in **Petroleum Geoscience** from **Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS**. I definitely need refresher course for this since my knowledge in Geoscience domain was outgrown with Information Technology.
