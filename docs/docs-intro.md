# Docs & Notes Basic

## What Is This?

This mostly will be notes and related graphics for things that I will be learning for the forseeable future. 

Currently I'm learning [Kubernetes from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/) with the aim to try and get CKA certification. I'm also trying to understand more on practical cybersecurity, hence the account on [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/p/FakeAdmin).

## About Docusaurus and Netlify

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) documentation, pushed to [Github](https://github.com/haikalbaik) with deployment to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) in place. The whole process is pretty easy to setup. I will do a writeup and link it here in near future. 

## What to Expect

This serve as reminder that I need to showcase what I know. I was watching [Heath Adams video aka TheCyberMentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J09yWM9c4x8) last week and the key takeaway I get was there is a need for people to know what we as individual can do.

Some important usurps from that video:-

- **Active blog or love to write regardless of platforms.**
- **Github is a place to showcase some work, even if most are personal or learning projects.**
- **Giving talk or attended related conferences is a good way to connect with relevant people.**
- **Volunteer work can impress people.**

Though not related, but specific to that video is **the creation of homelab**. This is considered a must if you are new to IT world. 

## Ability Showcase 

This will be the ultimate aim. If I can't understand my own documents, that means I am yet to understand let alone showcase my ability in that particular interests.
